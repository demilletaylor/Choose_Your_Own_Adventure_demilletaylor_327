    <h1>Chapter One</h1>
    <p> Your teacher has called the class to meet on the terrace of the Arts & History Complex at 4:00PM. Upon your arrival, each student receives an envelope, but youâ€™re told that no one will understand what the clue means until the object is found. On the back of the envelope is a QR code, which directs you to the app dedicated to providing the clues. You may only see the next clue when you enter a numeric code that is only available at each location. Before you're dismissed, the professor announces that up to four students can earn the final exemption, so you can choose to work alone or in groups.</p>
