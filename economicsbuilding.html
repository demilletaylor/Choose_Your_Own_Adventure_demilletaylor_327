                <p>You arrive in the promenade and enter the main lobby, you begin to rack your brain to make sense of the numbers. You look again at the clue, and see the word "mean" underlined along with the set of the number, and realize you have to calculate the mean. You open up your calculator and the result is 101. You head straight to room 101, open the door and look around. At first you don't anything at first.  head to the shelf where the book was originally located, and a new numeric code is taped to the top of the shelf. You enter the code, and the next clue appears on your screen, "The study of the <U>mean</U> green global machine <U>{81,99,123}</U>." </p>
