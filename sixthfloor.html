            <h1>6th floor: return to sender</h1>
            <p>You finally make it to the 6th floor stacks. You head to the shelf where the book was originally located,
                and a new numeric code is taped to the top of the shelf. You enter the code, and the next clue appears
                on your screen,"The study of the <U>mean</U> green global machine <U>{81,99,123}</U>."</p>
            <p>You instantly recognize "mean green" as money, and think of the Economics Building, but the numbers aren't clicking yet. You decide to figure it out on the way.</p>
