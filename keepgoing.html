                <p>You talk with your peers, and you make a deal with them. Since you helped them escape, they have to help you finish the scavenger hunt. They agree and you all calm down, regroup, and get back to business. </p>
                <p>You review the clue that lead you to the gallery. "Preservation of <em>our</em> past. A sight to see." One of your peers suggests the Campus History Archive in the Library. You look at the clue once again to see the emphasis on "our" and it clicks. You all head over to the library.</p>
