    <p> Finals season is here! Everyone on campus is either studying in their dorm, or tucked into a corner at the library. Your interactive design professor has created a scavenger hunt, and the student that succeeds will be exempt from the final project and automatically receive an A for the semester. Through this adventure, you will stumble across aspects of the universityâ€™s dark past. Are you ready to unlock the secrets of the campus and solve the ultimate puzzle?</p>
