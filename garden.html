                <p>You enter the garden and head straight for the fountain. You see a small floatation device moving around the base, but can't reach it. You look everywhere for a stick to help you. You don't find anything initally, but you keep looking and find one in a bush. You fish the object out of the water, open it, and there is set of four, four-sided  die inside. You have try to figure out the combination by organizing them in the right order. After seven tries, you finally get the right combo and get the next clue. "Preservation of our past. A sight to see." Your brain instantly goes to the Art & History Complex's museum gallery.</p>
