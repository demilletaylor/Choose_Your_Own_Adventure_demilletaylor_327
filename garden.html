                <h1>The Garden</h1>
                <p>You enter the garden and head straight for the fountain. in the promenade and enter the main lobby, you begin to rack your brain to make sense of the numbers. You look again at the clue, and see the word "mean" underlined along with the set of the numbers, and realize you have to calculate the mean.
                <p>You open up your calculator and the result is 101. You head straight to room 101, open the door and look around. At first you don't anything, but you glance at the whiteboard and the code is written subtly next to the projector screen.</p>
                <p>The next clue says, "Take a walk where peaceful waters flow." You instantly think of the garden's royal fountain and rush over before it gets dark.</p>
