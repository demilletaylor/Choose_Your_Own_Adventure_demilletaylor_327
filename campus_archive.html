                <p>You all arrive on the 5th floor where the archive is located. You enter the foyer and walk up to the desk, to greet the receptionist. He asks if you are in need of a code, and you can only enter if you have the correct clue. You read it off to him, "Preservation of <em>our</em> past. A sight to see." He leads you to the mural that showcases the campus' founders, pioneers, and changemakers. On the placard is the year that the mural was installed. You enter it into the app, and the clue says, "For our finale, take snapshot of this moment." You ask the receptionist to photograph you all in front of the mural and you immediately submit the photo.</p>
