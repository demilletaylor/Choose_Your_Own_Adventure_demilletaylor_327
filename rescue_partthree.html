            <h1>Rescue: Pt.3</h1>
            <p>The museum head is slumped over, so you hurry back to cut the pad lock. Everyone gets out, and you tell them you have to escape immediately. The museum head runs back, and begins wildly swinging the hammer, one your classmates picks up a glass case in the archive and cracks him over the head. He remain conscious and a fight ensues. He grabs you by the neck attempting to strangle you, and another classmate stabs him the screwdriver multiple times to weaken him. </p>
