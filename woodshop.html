            <h1>Wood Shop</h1>
            <p>You rush into the wood shop and go to the toolshed to look for anything that can compromise the locks. You find a set of tweezers, screwdrivers, and bolt cutters to breach the deadbolt and pad lock. You find a box to hold all of your clues and tools. As you exit the wood shop and head back to the gallery, you see the museum head walk by. You hide back inside and wait for him to pass. He leaves and you go down to the storage.</p>
