            <h1>Rescue: Pt.2</h1>
            <p>You dodge his hit, stumble over, grab the screwdriver, make a run for it. You dodge around the corner, fake him out by throwing the dice by the staircase, and hide behind one the statues in the archival room. As soon as he looks down at the dice, you stab him in the side to slow him down.</p>
