            <h1>Main Gallery: Investigate</h1>
            <p>You follow the sound and it leads to a storage room. There are stairs leading down to a basement filled with bankers boxes. You go downstairs where you can clearly hear multiple screaming "HELP", so you know they're trapped. You run toward the door and yell "ARE YOU OK?". The people inside, recognize your voice and say your name.

            <p>They tell you the museum head lured them inside and looked them in because they discovered the documents in the boxes. You glance over at the documents, that talk about paranormal activity and multiple murders on campus. You try to force the door open with no luck, so now you have to find something to break the lock.</p>
